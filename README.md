# k-Means-application
This project performs clustering analysis on a dataset of event attendees using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset includes attendees' industries, years of experience, and interests, and the goal is to identify patterns and groups based on these attributes.
## Project Overview

The code:
1. Loads and preprocesses a sample dataset of attendees.
2. Encodes categorical features using **Label Encoding**.
3. Standardizes the data to improve clustering performance.
4. Applies **K-Means Clustering** to group attendees into clusters.
5. Visualizes the clustering results with a scatter plot.
